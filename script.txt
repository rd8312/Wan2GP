[0:00]  Hello, little explorers!  👋
[0:03]  Today’s magic words are colors.  
[0:05]  Say it with me, nice and loud:  “Red.”  
[0:08]  Great!  Now touch something red around you.  
[0:11]  Ready?  “Blue.”  
[0:13]  Can you flap your arms like a blue bird? Flap-flap!  
[0:17]  Next is “Yellow.”  
[0:19]  Let’s shine like the yellow sun—arms big and round.  
[0:23]  Last one:  “Green.”  
[0:25]  Pretend you’re a tiny green frog—ribbit, ribbit!  
[0:29]  Fantastic!  Colors everywhere—red, blue, yellow, green.  
[0:32]  See you next adventure!  Bye-bye! 👋
